# Quid

Founders need truth. Users need rewards. Quid provides both.

## The Problem
Building on Stellar is fast, but getting real feedback is slow.
Most "users" are just bots looking for airdrops.
Founders waste time building features that nobody actually wants.

## The Solution
Quid is a bridge between the builder and the person using the app.
It turns feedback into a professional service.
It uses the Stellar ledger to prove a user is a real human, not a script.

## Core Truths
* **Signal over Noise:** We verify users via on-chain activity before they can give feedback.
* **Instant Gratification:** Rewards are paid in USDC the moment feedback is accepted.
* **Trustless Escrow:** Soroban smart contracts hold the bounty until the job is done.
* **Zero Friction:** Low Stellar fees mean we can pay users for even 2 minutes of their time.

## Tech Stack
* **Blockchain:** Stellar + Soroban (Smart Contracts).
* **Identity:** Freighter Wallet + On-chain transaction history.
* **Payments:** USDC (Stellar Assets).
* **Interface:** Next.js and Tailwind.

## How to Start
1. Connect your Stellar wallet.
2. If you are a founder, deposit a bounty and post a mission.
3. If you are a user, pick a mission and share your thoughts.
4. Get paid.
