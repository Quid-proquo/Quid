# quid-store

Escrowed bounty marketplace. A creator escrows `reward_amount * max_participants`
up front, hunters submit work against a stake, and the creator pays out
individually. This contract holds the escrow, the submission ledger and the
stake bookkeeping, and it is the only place that moves a hunter's money.

## Mission expiry

`expires_at` is an optional unix timestamp. `None` means "no deadline" and
behaves exactly like a mission created before this field existed.

- A mission is expired once `ledger.timestamp() >= expires_at` — the deadline
  second itself is already too late.
- `create_mission` rejects a deadline at or before the current timestamp
  (`ExpiryInThePast`), so a mission can never start out already expired.
- Once expired, `submit_feedback` fails with `MissionExpired`. Existing
  submissions survive: the owner can still pay out, slash or cancel them, so a
  deadline never strands work a hunter already delivered.
- `expire_mission` is **permissionless**. The deadline is public state, so
  requiring the owner's signature would only hand a departed founder a way to
  keep escrowed funds locked. It refunds
  `(max_participants - participants_count) * reward_amount` — the slots that
  were never paid out — to the owner, marks the mission `Cancelled`, emits
  `MissionExpiredEvent { mission_id, refunded }` and returns the amount.
- `expire_mission` before the deadline fails with `MissionNotExpired`; calling
  it twice fails with `MissionClosed`, so it cannot be used to drain the escrow
  a second time.

## Payout attestations

`payout_participant` issues a `quid-payout` attestation for the hunter against
the CID they submitted, in `quid-reputation`. The store acts as the *issuer* and
the registry's own admin is left alone, so the store never has to be an admin
and cannot revoke anyone else's records.

The wiring is opt-in. With no registry configured, `attest_payout` returns
immediately and the payout path is byte-for-byte what it was before — the
reputation integration cannot break a mission that predates it. A
`PayoutAttestedEvent { mission_id, attestation_id }` is emitted whenever an
attestation is actually written.

## Security notes

- **Money only ever moves on the owner's signature.** `payout_participant`,
  `cancel_mission`, `pause_mission`, `update_mission_status` and
  `slash_hunter_stake` all call `mission.owner.require_auth()` before touching
  storage or a token. A hunter's own submission stake is authorized by the
  hunter in `submit_feedback`. Nothing in this contract pays on the strength of
  the caller's identity alone.
- **`slash_hunter_stake` is owner-gated, not caller-gated.** The stake leaves
  the store to the configured treasury (or is forwarded to the staking pool),
  never to the hunter and never to the caller, so a mission owner can confiscate
  spam but cannot redirect the pot.
- **Singleton config slots use a claim-then-handover rule.** `set_treasury`,
  `set_fee_collector`, `set_staking_pool` and `set_reputation_contract` require
  the *new* address to authorize the first claim, so nobody can front-run a
  freshly deployed contract and point its treasury at themselves. Once claimed,
  only the current holder can move the slot.
- **`expire_mission` is intentionally the one permissionless money path.** It
  cannot pay anyone but the mission's own owner, only refunds slots that were
  never paid, and is idempotent-by-error rather than idempotent-by-silence.
  Keeping it owner-gated is what would actually lock funds.
- **Cross-contract calls are pre-authorized, not implicitly trusted.**
  `forward_fee` and `attest_payout` use `authorize_as_current_contract` with an
  explicit `SubContractInvocation`, because a contract's implicit auth only
  covers its own direct sub-call. The nested `transfer` / `issue_attestation` is
  therefore authorized for this store and nothing wider.
- **Protocol fees are bounded.** `quote_protocol_fee` rejects a vault that
  returns a negative fee or one larger than the value it was quoted against, so
  a misconfigured collector cannot take more than the mission is worth.
- **Arithmetic is checked.** Escrow totals, refunds and fees all go through
  `checked_mul` / `checked_add` and surface `NegativeReward` rather than
  wrapping.
- **Missions created with a deadline are still paid out normally.** Expiry only
  blocks *new* submissions; it does not claw back rewards already earned.

## Wiring the optional collaborators

Each of these is independent and opt-in; do them in any order.

```bash
# slash destination
stellar contract invoke --id <STORE_ID> --source treasury --network testnet \
  -- set_treasury --new_treasury <TREASURY_ID>

# protocol fee vault (quid-fee-collector)
stellar contract invoke --id <STORE_ID> --source collector --network testnet \
  -- set_fee_collector --new_collector <FEE_COLLECTOR_ID>

# reputation registry (quid-reputation, already initialized)
stellar contract invoke --id <STORE_ID> --source registry --network testnet \
  -- set_reputation_contract --new_reputation <REPUTATION_ID>
```

## Tests

```bash
cargo test -p quid-store
```

The suite covers the happy path, capacity and double-spend guards, the fee
vault and staking pool integrations, plus negative authorization tests for
every owner-gated entrypoint.
